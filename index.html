    <h1>Tonka</h1>
    <p>
      This is a scratch project that (very slowly) draws the Mandelbrot set. Why
      you ask? This is not the question. The question is "To be or not to be?"
      and the answer to that is always TONKA. Here at casual coding we do things
      differently. We do not ask "Why?" - we ask "Why not?". As there was no
      suitable answer to the latter on in this specific case, I went ahead and
      did it. If you have any complaints you may direct your complaint towards
      any of the following people and you will be taken care of. Your feedback
      is important to us. Just use the specified code word and our personnel
      will know what to do.
    </p>

    <h2>How to run</h2>
    <p>
      Click the green flag to start. By clicking on the green flag again with
      the shift button pressed will enable Turbo Mode. You might want that,
      because without it the cat is so slow, it might as well invoke 7
      compilation steps to calculate each pixel. Use the feature at your own
      discretion. If you have any idea on how to auto-start the embedding,
      please let me know.
